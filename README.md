# TYPO3 changelog summary

The changelog provided at [docs.typo3.org](https://docs.typo3.org/c/typo3/cms-core/main/en-us/Index.html) is the first reference to have a look for changes applied to a new core version of TYPO3. Unfortunately the amount of entries on that page is overwhelming and because the respective headlines are phrased in too general terms, one has to open each article just to decide, whether the content even concerns one's scope.

This repository is an attempt to provide a list of as much as possible meaningful and informative descriptions of each change, packed into a table which can be sorted after version, subject and link (see note below).

### Sorting a table on github
Unfortunately github does not provide the functionality to sort table columns. There are attempts to create the table in JSON ([docs.gitlab.com](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#json)), but github didn't implement this feature, yet. If it's really necessary, to sort columns (which might be e.g. if you want to see all deprecations at once), then you can use [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo/related) with a custom script [github-sort-content](https://github.com/Mottie/GitHub-userscripts/blob/master/github-sort-content.user.js).
